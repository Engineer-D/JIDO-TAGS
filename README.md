# Problem

With increased rate of armed robbery and kidnapping around, the safety of citizens are threatened.
Imagine a situation where one is a victime of this and his/her location is unknown.

# Proposed Solution

A smart watch that protects citizens from robbery. It could tell when you are scared,
send your location to the nearest police station and to your next of kin
and contains a kind of teaser.

# Proposed Stack

Django, Arduino, C, Mysql
